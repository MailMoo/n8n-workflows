# N8N Workflows Collection - MailMoo.io

Welcome to our collection of n8n workflows! This repository contains all the automation workflows that we create and demonstrate on our [YouTube channel @MailMoo-io](https://www.youtube.com/@MailMoo-io).

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for all the n8n automation workflows we showcase in our YouTube tutorials. Each workflow is carefully documented and corresponds to specific video tutorials on our channel.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The workflows are organized in the `workflows` directory. Each workflow is saved as a JSON file that can be imported directly into your n8n instance.

Current workflows:

- `personalize-video-workflow.json` - A workflow for video personalization
